CHAPTER 1

At the funeral of Eli Vance, Magnusson says 

MAGNUSSON: "Eli Vance was a good friend, a good colleague, and a good father. 
	He always had brilliant ideas for the progress of mankind , and he brave and tirelessly fought against the forces that have undergone our species for a long time to regain our freedom.
	It is truly hard to concieve that our most recent victory has been overshadowed by the departure of a beloved friend as Eli Vance was
	To honour him, it is my, and was his, wish that we should destroy the Borealis, to prevent it from  falling into the hands of our greatest enemies"
	I am sure his loving daughter, Alyx, will fulfill this wish."

Magnusson steps down. You turn around and see people leaving, murmuring to each other.

REBEL TALKS 

	REBEL 1: "The super portal seems to be gone, good thing the rocket launch worked."

	REBEL 2: "Yeah, but It's too bad that the advisors got Eli before Gordon and Alyx left"

	REBEL 1: "I just wonder about Alyx... she doesn't quite seem herself"

	REBEL 2: "It must be hard, losing your father like that. Everybody is looking on her to follow through with her fathers plans."

	REBEL 1: "You mean about the Borealis? Hmm, I thought is obvious that it is a better idea saving it to use against the Combine."

	REBEL 2: "What do you mean? That would be dangerous, it should be destroyed immediately!"

	REBEL 1: "But Dr. Kleiner has shown that with the technology on that ship, we could defeat the Combine for good."

	REBEL 2: "That's a stronger reason to destroy it. If the Combine reach it before we do, they could could totally exterminate us."

	REBEL 1: "Yes, but if the Combine reach it before we do, we can't destroy it anyway. Better to take what you can have then destroy it."

	REBEL 2: "I think we should spend more time in weapons research. Dr. Magnusson has been attempting to create a long-range missile that could destroy the Borealis. If we let him have more time, he could possibly make one."

	REBEL 1: "We should be spending more effort on trying to take the ship then to destroy it. With that power..."

	REBEL 2: "Stop that..."


	REBEL 3: "Well, seems like they are preparing us to travel for the search of that so-called "Borealis"

	REBEL 4: "Yeah, i've heard that ship was lost in ages, and it has a lot of science stuff inside of it"

	REBEL 3: "What type of sience stuff."

	REBEL 4: "I believe its something powerful, like... i don't know, maybe a super weapon or things like that"

	REBEL 3: "Whew, Do you think they will let us use it?"

	REBEL 4: "We are not going to play with some kind of toys, we are going to destroy that ship when we will find it."

	REBEL 3: "WHAT? Why do they want us to do that? Its stupid"

	REBEL 4: "Calm down, I am sure we will know once we get there"

	REBEL 3: "But, I don't understand, if that Borealis thing can help us to win this blasted war, Why do they want to blow the crap out of it? We"

	REBEL 4: "They must have their reasons, we need to trust them. We are not scientists anyway."


	REBEL 5: "What do you think about Dr. Magnusson and Dr. Kleiner arguing about the Borealis?"

	REBEL 6: "I think we should be quiet and let do their thing."

	REBEL 5: "Really? I would like to know what I am going to be ordered to do."

	REBEL 6: "You want to get expelled over a stupid ship?"

	REBEL 5: "Of course not, I just want to know what they are doing. Eli always told us."

	REBEL 6: "Well Eli's dead. So just do your work."

	REBEL 5: "You can't expel me. People can't get kicked out of rebels."

	REBEL 6: "Well I think I can arrange something if you really want to."

	REBEL 5: "Ok, I will be quiet."

	REBEL 6: "Finally."

**********

As you walk by a door to a hangar, you hear Alyx shout

ALYX: "I just don't know what to do!".
When you walk in you see Alyx sitting against a wall with Magnusson standing next to her. Magnusson reaches down to 
comfort her, but then sees you. Clearing his throat, Magnusson straightens and says

MAGNUSSON: "Well, Gordon, good to see you. I was just comforting Alyx here."

Alyx looks at the ground. 
Off to the left through a window you see G-Man watching. 

After a pause

MAGNUSSON: "Right Alyx?"

ALYX (sullenly): "Yes, Gordon, he was just helping me get over my grief."

Magnusson clears his throat and starts walking toward you, saying

MAGNUSSON: "Well, I wish you both the best of luck on your adventure."

Magnusson walks out of the building.
G-Man is nowhere to be seen.
Alyx stands up slowly, saying

ALYX: "Well Gordon, lets check on the supplies and be off."

Dog walks over and "embraces" Alyx, but Alyx shoves him off saying

ALYX: "Dog No!"

She pushes him off.

Dog looks sad

ALYX: "I'm sorry Dog, I don't know what came..."

Pause

ALYX: "Forget it, lets go Gordon."

**********

There would be 3 people in the helicopter
Gordon, Alyx, And a rebel pilot (cause i don't think alyx or gordon could fly a helicopter)

In the helicopter flying to the arctic

Alyx: Alright Gordon… this will be a hard job, but Once we reach to the Borealis, we must destroy it… Completely. I just hope my dad was correct...

The radar goes of seeing multiple objects coming at them

The Pilot: What? I’m receiving multiple signals of objects coming to~ Oh No!! They’re onto us!

Alyx: What? Oh no, 

The pilot would try to out maneuver but it would be too much to dodge

The Pilot: Brace Yourselves! Prepare for Impact!!!!

If you looked to the left you would be able to the shell go through the helicopter

The helicopter would start to spin and would fall to the ground

Alyx: Agh No! Gordon hold on!!

**********

The helicopter crashes

Alyx: No!

the screen would go black for a second and you would hear the gordon freeman breathing and after a few seconds you would see gordon freeman opening his eyes

The screen would be a bit blurry

Alyx: Gordon… no please… you too...

Gordon Stands up

Alyx: Gordon! Oh god i thought you...

Alyx would give Gordon a hug. After that, the player would have full control
