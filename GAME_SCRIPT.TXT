CHAPTER 1

The game will begin with a black screen showing the title and starting with the very first part of Magnuson's
speech in the background, then the funeral scene will apear slowly as a transition and Magnusson keeps talking,

MAGNUSSON: "Eli Vance was a good friend, a good colleague, and a good father. He always had brilliant ideas for the progress of mankind, and he bravely and tirelessly fought against the forces that have tried to dominate our species. It is truly hard to concieve that our most recent victory has been overshadowed by the departure of such a beloved friend as Eli Vance was. To honour him, it is my, and was his, wish that we should destroy the Borealis, to prevent it from falling into the hands of our greatest enemies. I am sure his loving daughter, Alyx, will fulfill this wish.

He standsproud with generals sitting behind him, and a closed casket in front of him. The hangar is quiet except for his voice until it stops.

Mag shouts out

MAGNUSSON: "The Combine will fall. They shall be destroyed. Our forces will avenge our loved ones, and bring about a new age of peace and prospertity!" 

After his speech, Mag will step down and disappear among the crowd. The crowd disperses and Gordon is controlled by himself. Outside where small groups of Rebels gather around to speak against walls, by the helicopters, or just anywhere. The player can now free roam and explore the facility. Gordon will find his objective after searching and speaking with Kleiner who is at a workbench, repairing a radio as Rebels sit and relax around him. 

**********

KLEINER: "Good morning Freeman!" Kleiner would say happily then fall into a depression,  "Well, we've had better ones"

Kleiner places his radio down and approaches Freeman

KLEINER: "I've known Eli for many long years; in fact, I still remember the day when he entered Black Mesa. I knew he would be special in some way, yet I was ignorant until now. I wish he was told of how important he was to everyone before his unjust death, but there is no need to cry now; there's only need to be happy. I am sure Alyx would help finish what he began, but I'm not sure how she's holding up. Can you check on her? I know that she is a very strong young woman, but witnessing her father die might have broken her. From what I hear, she's in another hangar area, so please check on her - she might need you, Gordon. Oh, and I just finished fixing up your old Gravity Gun. It is over there."

Kleiner walks to other experiments, checking on them and doing stuff as he speaks, including desperately looking for Lamarr.

The door to Alyx's hangar would be opened once you got the grav gun.

**********

As you walk around, you hear rebels arguing with each other.

REBEL TALKS 

	REBEL 1: "The super portal seems to be gone, good thing the rocket launch worked."

	REBEL 2: "Yeah, but it's too bad that the advisors got Eli before Gordon and Alyx left."

	REBEL 1: "I just wonder about Alyx... she doesn't quite seem herself"

	REBEL 2: "It must be hard, losing your father like that. Everybody is looking on her to follow through with her fathers plans."

	REBEL 1: "You mean about the Borealis? Hmm, I thought it is obvious that it is a better idea saving it to use against the Combine."

	REBEL 2: "What do you mean? That would be dangerous, it should be destroyed immediately!"

	REBEL 1: "But Dr. Kleiner has shown that with the technology on that ship, we could defeat the Combine for good."

	REBEL 2: "That's a stronger reason to destroy it. If the Combine reach it before we do, they could could totally exterminate us."
	
	REBEL 1: "Yes, but if the Combine reach it before we do, we can't destroy it anyway. Better to take what you can have then destroy it."

	REBEL 2: "I think we should spend more time in weapons research. Dr. Magnusson has been attempting to create a long-range missile that could destroy the Borealis. If we let him have more time, he could possibly make one."

	REBEL 1: "We should be spending more effort on trying to take the ship then to destroy it. With that power..."

	REBEL 2: "Stop that..."


	REBEL 3: "Well, seems like they are preparing us to travel for the search of that so-called "Borealis""

	REBEL 4: "Yeah, I've heard that ship was lost ages ago, and it has a lot of science stuff inside of it"

	REBEL 3: "What type of science stuff."

	REBEL 4: "I believe its something powerful, like... I don't know, maybe a super weapon or something like that"

	REBEL 3: "Whew, Do you think they will let us use it?"

	REBEL 4: "We are not going to play with some toys, we are going to destroy that ship when we will find it."

	REBEL 3: "WHAT? Why do they want us to do that? It's stupid"

	REBEL 4: "Calm down, I am sure we will know once we get there"

	REBEL 3: "But, I don't understand, if that Borealis thing can help us to win this blasted war, Why do they want to blow the crap out of it? We..."

	REBEL 4: "They must have their reasons, we need to trust them. We are not scientists anyway."


	REBEL 5: "What do you think about Dr. Magnusson and Dr. Kleiner arguing about the Borealis?"

	REBEL 6: "I think we should be quiet and let them do their thing."

	REBEL 5: "Really? I would like to know what I am going to be ordered to do."

	REBEL 6: "You want to get removed over a stupid ship?"

	REBEL 5: "Of course not, I just want to know what they are doing. Eli always told us."

	REBEL 6: "Well, Eli's dead. So just do your work."

	REBEL 5: "You can't expel me. People can't get kicked out of rebels."

	REBEL 6: "Well I think I can arrange something if you really want to."

	REBEL 5: "Ok, I will be quiet."

	REBEL 6: "Finally."
	
REBEL RESPONSES BELOW

	"Hello."
	"Sorry for your loss, Freeman."
	"We'll make the Combine pay!"
	"When will this war end?"
	"Gordon, you are a doctor right? *mumbles* Seems like there are a lot of doctors around here."
	"Do you think Eli's looking down at us wherever he is?"
	"The Borealis better be a real thing."
	"Ah! You scared me, Freeman."
	"Hey, Freeman, is this about the wrench? I didn't know it was yours."
	"Hello, Gordon!"
	"Are you going to tell us stories about Black Mesa, Gordon?"
	*whisper* "Hey, Gordon, what's so important about Eli?"
	"I wonder how Alyx is dealing with all this."
	"God, what I would do for a drink around here."
	"I've lost a whole lot back at City 17, and not much has changed. I'm going to miss Eli."
	"I'm going to take a finger from each Combine freak I see to honour Eli. If they have any."
	"I miss my home, Freeman, and now I must miss someone like Eli. Please, avenge Mister Vance and finish this war. I want to go 		home."
	"Sometimes... I dream about cheese."
	"You smell that? That's freedom."
	"We're about to drop the hammer, you'll see."
	"Please. Don't keep me waiting."
	"We should be used to these things happening by now. We know it's bound to happen sooner or later, but when they do... it never gets easier. It never does"

**********

Gordon would travel to a different hangar where he would find Alyx sitting alone with Dog standing beside her. Mag would be speaking to her, but not clearly heard, but stops when he notices Gordon. after Mag stops, he clears his throat,

MAGNUSSON: "Didn't see you there, Gordon," he fixes his tie, "I was comforting Alyx over here."

MAG: "Right Alyx?" He asks her.

She looks up at Gordon then back at Mag before speaking, 

ALYX: "Yes, he was helping me." 

Mag smiles and approaches Gordon, saying, 

MAGNUSSON: "Well Gordon.... good luck, and be careful. I wouldn't want to lose you and her over a simple search and destroy mission."

Mag leaves, and Alyx retreats her head to face the floor. Dog places a hand on her shoulder and comfortly makes mechanical noises only to be yelled at, 

ALYX: "Get off of me!"

Dog backs up, whimpering. Alyx stands and tries to comfort Dog, worried, 

ALYX: "I'm sorry. I don't know what came o-" She pauses then looks to Gordon, "Forget it," she says, "Let's go Gordon." 

**********

Gordon and Alyx stroll through the facility and arrive at the helicopter at its landing pad. Dog follows them.

They watch Rebel soldiers yelling out as they places equipment on the roaring copter, 

REBEL: "It's gonna be a frozen bleak world up there, and with the Combine, you're gonna be in for one hell of a treat!" 

Alyx smirks and says through her strained voice, 

ALYX: "I'm ready for anything." 

Alyx climbed into the copter and straps herself in. Gordon follows and sits opposite to her. Dog waves at Alyx, and Alyx waves back frantically. 

The helicopter lifts up, and the chapter ends.

**********

CHAPTER 2

Gordon, Alyx, And a rebel pilot. In the helicopter flying to the arctic.

Alyx: Gordon, I know you didn't have to do this. It was my fath...

The radar goes of seeing multiple objects coming at them

The Pilot: What? I’m receiving multiple signals of objects coming to~ Oh No!! They’re onto us!

Alyx: What? Oh no.

The pilot would try to outmaneuver but it would be too much to dodge

The Pilot: Brace Yourselves! Prepare for Impact!!!!

If you looked to the left you would be able to see a shell go through the helicopter

The helicopter would start to spin and would fall to the ground

Alyx: Agh No! Gordon hold on!!

**********

The helicopter crashes

Alyx: No!

the screen would go black for a second and you would hear the Gordon breathing and after a few seconds you would see Gordon opening his eyes.

The screen would be a bit blurry

Alyx: "Gordon... no... please no.... not again..."

Gordon stands up

Alyx: Gordon! Oh god I thought you...

Alyx would give Gordon a hug. After that, the player would have full control

There are some tall towers with power lines going between them near you.

All the weapons are gone except the Grav gun and Alyx's gun

ALYX: "I think your gravity gun is over there. I still have my gun."

Alyx sees some combine

ALYX: "There are some combine headed this way. Hide!"

The scouts arrive. 

ALYX: "Look, Gordon! we could really use some weapons right now."

You choose to stay hidden, or attack them. If you stay hidden, patrols will not attack you on your journey. If you attack, they patrols will attack you on your journey.

********

You and Alyx walk toward the power lines. The wind starts turning into a snowstorm. As the duo travels through the snow for a short period of time, Alyx speaks in a melancholy tone, 

ALYX: "You shouldn't have came, Gordon. I'm sorry that you came, and that you followed me." 

She looks at Gordon ocassionally, and sometimes stopping to turn to him. 

ALYX: "Eli was my father, not yours. I have to finish what he wanted; you shouldn't have wanted to help." She continues, "The Rebellion needs you, Gordon, but they don't need me. If you die here, what will happen? But if I die here, nothing will change." 

She sighs, 

ALYX: "I'm sorry, Gordon." 

Eventually they find the combine outpost.

*********

As they approach it, they don't see a entrance. Alyx proposes you walk around it. As you walk around, you see a dropoff. As you near it, you see a body. This body is hanging from the edge by two ice picks, it is frozen to them. 

ALYX: "Those could be useful. Lets bring it with us."

You have to use E to grab the picks and the body will fall.

You then see a ledge below.

ALYX: "I think you can get to the ledge with those icepicks. Lets try it."

You get there and climb down to the bottom.

ALYX: "Do you see anyway to get me down?"

You walk around a little bit and grab some pieces of a machine. Once you put about (3) in a machine, some unknown aliens attack you.

ALYX: "What's happening down there?"

You fight some more, then get the lift to start. Once the lift is going up some more aliens attack you

********

Alyx comes down and you explore the cave

LEVEL DESIGNERS THE CAVE IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE AT THIS POINT

********

When you are exploring you have the feeling of being watched. After you walk into a room you see a slanted ceiling with a hole in the top. A forcefield appears around the doors.

ALYX: "We are trapped."

Different waves of combine come through the doors and you fight them off. Suddenly elite combine press you in from all sides and as you back into the middle. A net is thrown on top of you from above. As you struggle to get out, a cremator walks into the room and stands over you. He says something intelligible with the word Breen.

On the way to Breen, you wake up, and hear his voice. (Like in HL1)

BREEN: "They are? Good. Bring them in." 

You "fall asleep" again.

The Chapter ends
